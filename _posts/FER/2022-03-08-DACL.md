## Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild via Deep Attentive Center Loss
#### -DACL-

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07270.pdf)ðŸ˜™ 

## Intro

widely used softmax loss is incapable of yielding discriminative features in wild scenarios. 
Deep Metric Learning(DML) approaches constrain the embedding space to obtain well-discriminated deep features. 
In a typical DML problem, the deep feature equally contributes to the DMLâ€™s objective function along all dimensions. Therefore, DML methods are prone to discriminate redundant and noisy information along with important information encoded in the deep feature vector. This leads to over-fitting and hinders the generalization ability of the learning algorithm
Paper designed a modular attention-based DML approach, called Deep Attentive Center Loss (DACL), to selectively learn to discriminate exclusively the relevant information in the embedding space.
